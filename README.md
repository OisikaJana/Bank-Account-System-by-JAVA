# Bank-Account-System-by-JAVA
A simple basic level banking system project by java
How the Code Works:
BankAccount Class:

This class represents a bank account.
It has two main properties: accountHolderName (the name of the account holder) and balance (the account balance).
It has methods for depositing money, withdrawing money, checking the balance, and displaying account details.
BankAccountManagementSystem Class:

This is the main class where the program execution starts.
It prompts the user to create an account by entering the account holder's name.
It then displays a menu with options to deposit money, withdraw money, check the balance, display account details, or exit the system.
The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.
